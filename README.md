# Java-Mini-Projects
A collection of Java projects that exemplify a wide array of programming concepts and methodologies, providing an 
opportunity to enhance Java programming skills.

MaxCarsApp: This program demonstrates the calculation of the maximum number of consecutive arrivals in a parking lot. It takes an array of arrival and departure times, transforms it to indicate arrivals and departures, sorts the array by time, and calculates the maximum consecutive arrivals.

The program continuously displays the menu until the user decides to exit by entering 'q' or 'Q'.

ShallowVsDeepCopyApp: This program serves as a comparison between shallow copy and deep copy techniques on a 2D array.

TicTacToeApp: This program is a console-based implementation of the popular Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing two players to take turns to play. The TicTacToeApp program lets two players take turns in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid.
